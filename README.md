<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

You will have to run this project in a java runtime enivronment.

### Prerequisites
#### Installing Java

#### Linux


The instructions below are for installing version Java 8 Update 73 (8u73). If you are installing another version, make sure you change the version number appropriately when you type the commands at the terminal. Example: For Java 8u79 replace 8u73 with 8u79. Note that, as in the preceding example, the version number is sometimes preceded with the letter u, and sometimes it is preceded with an underbar, for example, jre1.8.0_73.

Note about root access: To install Java in a system-wide location such as /usr/local, you must login as the root user to gain the necessary permissions. If you do not have root access, install Java in your home directory or a subdirectory for which you have write permissions.

[Download for Linux](https://java.com/en/download/linux_manual.jsp)

Change to the directory in which you want to install. Type:
cd directory_path_name
For example, to install the software in the /usr/java/ directory, Type:
```sh
cd /usr/java/
```
Move the .tar.gz archive binary to the current directory.
Unpack the tarball and install Java
```sh
tar zxvf jre-8u73-linux-x64.tar.gz
```

The Java files are installed in a directory called jre1.8.0_73 in the current directory. In this example, it is installed in the /usr/java/jre1.8.0_73 directory. When the installation has completed, you will see the word Done.
Delete the .tar.gz file if you want to save disk space.
